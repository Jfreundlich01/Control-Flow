//We fork so that everyone has permission to edit. We also fork that it shows up on our own reposity.

// Easy Going
// Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20.

// for(let i = 1; i<=20; i++){
//     console.log(i)
// }

//## Get Even
//1. Write a `for` loop that will log only the even numbers in 0 through 200.
//>Hint: Think about the increment expression.

// for(let i = 0; i <=200; i+=2){
//     console.log(i)
// }

//## Excited Kitten
//1. Write code that logs "Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!" 20 times.

let i = 0

while(i<=20){
    console.log("Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!")
    i++;
}


//2. For every **even** number in your loop, log "...human...why you taking pictures of me?...", "...the catnip made me do it...", or "...why does the red dot always get away..." at random.



//>Hint: You will need to use Math.random()
